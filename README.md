<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

The Quiz CLI project is a command-line interface (CLI) application that allows users to take a quiz and get immediate feedback on their answers. The quiz is composed of multiple-choice questions with four possible answers, and users can submit their answers to the server to get their score.

The project is written in the Go programming language and uses popular packages like Cobra for CLI management and Viper for configuration. It also makes use of RESTful APIs to communicate with the server and exchange data.

The Quiz CLI project is a great example of how to build a simple yet powerful CLI application using Go and popular third-party packages. The project can be used as a starting point for building more complex CLI applications with Go.

### Built With

This project is built with Golang and utilizes the Cobra CLI library for command-line interface functionality. It also makes use of the HTTP package for network communication and the encoding/json package for JSON decoding.
